## About

Welcome to the Get PUMPED Tracker!

The inspiriation for this app came from my love of exercise. I have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life and never really knew how to deal with it. That was until I started working out. Fitness has helped me to overcome my depression and I love the feeling I get walking out of a gym after a crazy workout. 

The Get PUMPED Tracker will help others to set fitness goals, keep track of their completed workout routines and write any motivational quotes they would like someone else to see! 

Hope you Enjoy!

## Content

- Main Index page gives a brief explanation of why I decided to make this application.

- Workout page is all about feeling the burn! As a user, you can add a new workout, include whether you felt a pump or not and when you completed this work out. If your a guest, you can only view what others have done so sign up!

- Profile page shows everyone who has logged in before, whether they added a workout or not. CLicking a profile will inform you whether that person has set any personal goals.

- Pump Quotes page is where a user can come and leave a motivational or funny quote to help PUMP up others!
