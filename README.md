## About

I loved watching cartoons as a kid and some shows have stuck with me throughout my life. These are just a few I enjoyed watching. 

The 90s Cartoon Quiz Game is a fun quiz testing the players knowledge on some popular 90s cartoons. The player will have 25 secs to answer all 8 questions within the selected category. If time runs out, the game is over! See if you can get a perfect score!
